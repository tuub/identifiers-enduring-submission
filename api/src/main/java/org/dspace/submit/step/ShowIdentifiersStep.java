/**
 * This step shows previously minted persistent identifiers (handle, doi, ...)
 * so that an author can include them into his/her files. This feature cannot be
 * included in any official release of DSpace as the JSPUI won't be continued in
 * DSpace 7 and all following minor versions of DSpace 6 will contain bugfixes
 * only. Therefore we developped this feature in a way that keeps it as close to
 * the existing code as possible, to keep minor verison updates as simple as
 * possible. In JSPUI's JSPStepManager there is a bug. It detects a step as
 * non-interactive one, by checking if a JSP was called enduring the step's
 * pre-processing. Non-interactive steps are steps working in the background of
 * the submission process, no being listed in the progress bar, not calling any
 * JSPs. Therefore for any step detected as non-inveractive one its
 * post-processing method is never called. To keep updates simple we decided to
 * not fix the bug, but to create two submission steps: one step mints the
 * identifiers without showing any JSP in the pre-processing. The other one
 * shows identifiers in the preprocessing without doing anything in the
 * processing and in the post-processing. This step is the one shpwing the
 * previously minted identifiers.
